```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Package
```{r}
library(arules)
library(arulesViz)
```

## Data
```{r}
bankdata <- read.csv("~/Downloads/bankdata.csv")
str(bankdata)
```

# Pre-processing
### Remove ID
remove id column
```{r}
bankdata <- subset(bankdata, select=-c(id))

str(bankdata)
```

### Discretize income into a new factor
discretize= sort into 3 class in a new column
```{r}
bankdata$income.bracket <- discretize(bankdata$income, method = "frequency", breaks = 3, labels = c("low", "medium", "high"))

str(bankdata)
```

### Discretize age into a new factor
```{r}
bankdata$age.group <- discretize(bankdata$age, method = "frequency", breaks = 3, labels = c("young", "adult", "elder"))

str(bankdata)
```
 
### Convert other columns to factors
convert non-numeric column into numeric
```{r}
cols <- c("sex", "region", "married", "children", "car", "save_act", "current_act", "mortgage", "pep")

bankdata[cols] <- lapply(bankdata[cols], factor)

str(bankdata)
```

### Convert the bankdata to transactional data
```{r}
bankdata_tr <- as(bankdata[, sapply(bankdata, is.factor)], "transactions")

str(bankdata_tr)
```
# Lab - My part

## whether the customer buy a pep or not
pre-defined RHS, which is pep = NO and pep = YES
```{r}
rules <- apriori(data = bankdata_tr, parameter = list(support = 0.05, confidence = 0.9),appearance = list(rhs=c('pep=YES','pep=NO') ))

```


```{r}
#check whether the rules combine pep=NO and pep=YES at the same time.
#inspect(rules)
```

## Check the top 5
Pick two rules and try to explain the reasons.
```{r}
#inspect(head(sort(rules, by="confidence"), 5))
inspect(head(sort(rules, by="lift"), 5))
```
From the top 5 sorts by lift, we can see that all 5's lift > 1, which means lhr and rhs are positively correlated.
To be more specific, we can say that. If the customer has children, has a  current account, and income is high level, he/she will buy a pep. Maybe they think pep is an excellent financial product, and they also need to buy this to save their children's education.

## Find new rules
Add minlen = 5 into the parameter and generate new rules.
```{r}
rules_new <- apriori(data = bankdata_tr, parameter = list(support = 0.05, confidence = 0.9, minlen = 5),appearance = list(rhs=c('pep=YES','pep=NO') ) )
inspect(head(sort(rules_new, by="confidence"), 5))
```

After setting the minimum number of items = 5, from the top 5 sorts by confidence we can see that.
if the customer is married, has no child, and has a current account, he won't buy a PEP even his income is very high. It maybe the customer doesn’t need to buy financial products for future investment, and also he doesn't save money for children's education.

## More limitations
```{r}
rules_more <- apriori(data = bankdata_tr, parameter = list(support = 0.1, confidence = 0.45, maxlen=13,minlen = 4),appearance = list(rhs=c('pep=YES','pep=NO') ) )
inspect(head(sort(rules_more, by="support"), 5))
```
After setting the minimum number of items = 4,maximum number of item =13 ,from the top 5 sorts by support we can see that.
if the customer is married, has an account(saving or current or both), he won't buy a PEP even he doesn't have a mortgage. It maybe the customer doesn’t need to buy a financial product to support his future life, and also he believes in saving money in the bank, rather than buying financial products. he may also think is a fraud after the financial crisis happened in 2008.
